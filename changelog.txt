v1.0.0   - (April 29, 2024)
         - MAJOR: TAILMON is officially released today! Tailscale is a free and open source service, based on
           WireGuard®, that helps users build no-hassle virtual private networks. Once you’ve created a Tailscale
           network (tailnet), you can securely access services and devices on that tailnet from anywhere in the
           world.  TAILMON is a posix shell script that assists with the install, configuration and monitoring of
           Tailscale, running on your Asus-Merlin FW router. Wanted to give huge thanks to @jksmurf for lighting
           this fire… He opened my eyes to Tailscale and its capabilities, and only became natural to want to
           fullfill his wishes to create a formal installer/monitor for this valuable tool for others to enjoy.
           He, along with @Aiadi, @kuki68ster and @ColinTaylor made a fantastic team that has been working
           diligently in the background testing the capabilities, limits and stability of Tailscale on our routers.
           Hats off to all these gentlemen for their help and insight that went into making this tool!
