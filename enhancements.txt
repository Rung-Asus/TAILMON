TO-DO
-----
* Do more error/status checking on the install of tailscale entware packages, and during the startup of the service/connection... and if it errors out, present better messaging around that, and potentially stopping the script in order to do more troubleshooting.

DONE
----
* Determine if I can figure out what entware version is installed, and if it's below a certain threshold, put a stop to running the script until that version has been updated. Using opkg print-architecture command, check to see if it contains armv7-2.6. If it does then install the tailscale_nohf package, else just the normal tailscale package.
* Add an option for a "tailscale up --reset" for those needing a reset
* Show tailscale binary version in UI
* Gray out the (O) option on operations menu if Custom isn't enabled
* Provide for a method to update the Tailscale binaries to the latest version
* Build a services-start option to allow for auto-start after router reboot
